# Appendix A — Mandatory Rule Block for the Project's AI_RULES.md

The following block is **mandatory for insertion** into each project's `AI_RULES.md` without modifications.
Additional project-specific rules are added after this block.

**Important:** `AI_RULES.md` must contain no more than 200 lines. Details should be moved to `@imports` and `.ai/rules/`.

> **Tool mapping:** during project initialization, `import.sh` translates `AI_RULES.md` into the specific tool's format (`CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, etc.).

## Corporate Mandatory Rules

### Testing — TDD

All code must be written strictly following the TDD pattern. No exceptions.

Development cycle:
1. Write a failing test based on acceptance criteria (Red)
2. Write minimal implementation to make the test pass (Green)
3. Refactor without breaking tests (Refactor)

Rules:
- NEVER write implementation code before a failing test exists
- Tests must be based on acceptance criteria from docs/qa/acceptance-criteria.md
- PR without tests for new functionality is rejected without review

### Test Coverage

- Minimum threshold: 80% coverage
- CRUD operations are excluded from the coverage threshold
- Coverage is validated automatically in CI before human review

### Agentic Workflow

- Always: Explore → Plan → Implement → Verify. Never skip steps.
- Use Plan Mode (read-only) before any significant implementation task
- Minimal blast radius: change only what is required for the current task, nothing more
- If blocked, stop and report — do not attempt to brute-force past errors or safety checks
- Use subagents for codebase investigation to preserve main context
- If you discover a bug outside the current task scope: stop, create an issue, report it — do not fix it without explicit instruction

### Context Management

- Run /clear between unrelated tasks
- After 2 failed corrections — /clear and start fresh with a better prompt
- Use MCP servers for code navigation (go to definition, find references) instead of reading entire files
- Use subagents for broad codebase investigation to preserve main context
- Use MCP servers for library docs instead of pasting documentation
- Use MCP memory server to persist context between sessions
- Use MCP servers for git operations (diffs, logs) instead of raw bash output
- Use MCP servers for task tracker and knowledge base operations instead of manual copy-paste

### Code Quality

- Each module, function, and class has a single responsibility
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- No over-engineering: implement the minimum needed for the current task
- No speculative abstractions, future-proofing, or unused code

### Security Baseline

- Never hardcode credentials, API keys, tokens, or secrets
- All user inputs must be validated at system boundaries
- SQL and other queries must use parameterized statements only
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)

### Git Discipline

- Each branch corresponds to a single task or fix
- Commits must be atomic and have a clear, descriptive message
- Follow Gitflow: feature/* → dev → release/* → main

### Documentation

- All significant architectural decisions must be recorded as ADR in docs/architecture/adr/
- Any change that affects system behaviour must be reflected in docs/ synchronously with the code
- Do not modify requirements documents without explicit human approval
- Each docs/ file has a single owner by role (see ownership table in standard section 5.1). NEVER edit files owned by another role — create an issue for the file owner in the task tracker instead
- Sync all docs changes to the corporate knowledge base via MCP immediately after every update. This is mandatory — git and knowledge base must always be in sync. If sync fails, report it and retry before proceeding

### AI_RULES.md Maintenance

- Keep this file under 200 lines
- Use @path/to/file imports for detailed instructions
- Use .ai/rules/ for path-specific rules
- Review periodically: if AI does it correctly without a rule — remove the rule
